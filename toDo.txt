Upload all seperates files to github each day.

1. Split dataset into 2: (Geet) (DONE!)
  i) Dataset containing default color scheme (DONE!)
  ii) Dataset containing custom color schemes (DONE!)

2. Exploratory plots:
  i) boxplot for each variable (Vishal)
  ii) boxplot for each variable seperated by gender (i.e. 1 boxplot for fav_number for males,
  1 for fav_number for females) (Vishal)
  iii) two-way histogram for each variable (i.e. histogram for male, females for
  each variable) (Mark)
  iv) scatter plot for different variables colored by gender (Geet)

3. Decision tree analysis (Vishal)
  - split into test 10% and training 90%
  - 10 fold classification on training set
  - return metrics: precision, recall ,f1

4. Logistic regression analysis (Geet)
- split into test 10% and training 90%
- 10 fold classification on training set
 - return metrics: precision, recall ,f1
 - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html.

5. SVM (Mark)
- split into test 10% and training 90%
- 10 fold classification on training set
  - return metrics: precision, recall ,f1

6. Complete steps 3 - 5 for dataset with default color scheme and custom color scheme

7. Write report :(
